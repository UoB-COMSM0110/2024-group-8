## Design Options:

1. **Human Body:** 
- Different maps are different body part, e.g., liver, heart, etc
- Attackers are germs attempting to penetrate the body
- Defenders are different antibodies, which have different properties, and can destroy different germs
2. **University Campus:**
- Different maps are different building of the university/different areas of the uni
- Lecturers are the defenders of the campus, fighting off attacking students

## **3 Challenges:**

1. **Multiplayer:** 
- Where one one person operates the defence, upgrading the defence towers
- Whilst one upgrades the attackers and launches attacks

2. **Randomised attack:** 
- Each round can have an increasing difficulty
- But each play the kind/number of different kinds of enemies dispatched is randomised at run-time, so that you don’t know which order of attacks to expect
- E.g., Some enemies have special exteriors which can only be penetrated by certain defenders, but this can appear for the first time between a range levels, so you gamble on when to make certain upgrades to your defence

3. **Twist:** 
- Based on the level of difficulty you have a different ‘margin of error’, e.g., on easy mode the disease won’t take over the body until 100 defenders get through, but on hard mode you only have 20 lives until the disease takes over.
- Once you start letting enemies through, the temperature begins to rise, and the enemies become more intense/powerful?
- Physics element of they gain new abilities defending on the temperature increase
- E.g., You can have a defender tower which destroys enemies by freezing them to death, but once the temperature begins to rise, this effect becomes void

# Idea 2: Arcade Side-scroller

The main idea of this suggestion is that there are defined ‘sites’ or ‘areas’ which have their own theme and specific adversary/ physics/ secret.

## Design Options:

1. **“Through the Ages”** 
- From single-cell organism, ancient societies, medieval times to present day (and beyond).
- Attackers specific to location/time and impact can vary on narrative of advanced weaponry
- Possibly no defenders - only the player.

2. **World Tour: Across different countries and cultures**
- Opportunity to highlight areas of cultural significance - could relate to UNESCO World Heritage list.
- Educational - connect to national curriculum?

## 3 Challenges:

1. **“Chance Card”**
introduces a behaviour that fundamentally alters the physics. 
- Challenge will be creating physics and other mechanisms that can apply at any time and affect gameplay to different extents depending on current theme.
- Set of 5-8 examples introduced at start of play to players with a range of actions (similar to Mario kart). e.g. gravity changes by 90 degrees or light only visible in immediate area, or slowing of villains etc.
- TWIST: Adversaries can also play chance cards at random/pre-determined intervals.

2. **Generative Element**
- Each round/area is generated within a certain set of parameters, so it is always pseudo-unique.
- Lots of testing required to ensure generation creates levels that are both playable/fun and also complex enough to be challenging.

3. **Combining sprites**
- Potential for vehicles or other transportation method that the player can enter & then gain new features like speed or protection (horses, boats, cars, spaceships etc).
- Relationship between those elements, how the additional physics items are implemented and designed.
