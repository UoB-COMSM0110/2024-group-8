// // This is just notes for me so don't worry about it :) I was just starting to think about ways to clean up GameMap class in the future

// // When a new game is run, a new tower manager is created
// // This stores all the tower buttons & checks if any have been bought
// // It also stores which tower was last clicked so that in the menu bar that tower's stats are displayed

// class TowerManager {
//     TowerManager(){ }

    
    
    
    
//     // markLastClicked(DefenceTower towerLastClicked){
//     //     for (DefenceTower t : AllTowers){
//     //         if (t != towerLastClicked){
//     //             t.setLastClicked(false);
//     //         }
//     //     }
//     // }
// }
