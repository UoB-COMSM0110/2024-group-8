// When a new game is run, a new tower manager is created
// This stores all the tower buttons & checks if any have been bought
// It also stores which tower was last clicked so that in the menu bar that tower's stats are displayed

// This is just notes for me so don't worry about it :) I was just thinking about ways to clean up GameMap class in the future

//Class TowerManager {
//    TowerManager(){ }

//    markLastClicked(DefenceTower towerLastClicked){
//        for (DefenceTower t : AllTowers){
//            if (t != towerLAstClicked){
//                t.setLastClicked(false);
//            }
//        }
//    }
//}
